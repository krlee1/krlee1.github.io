# About Me

I am a second-year MS/PhD integrated student in [Electrical and Computer Engineering](https://ece.snu.ac.kr/) at [Seoul National University](https://www.snu.ac.kr/index.html). Under the supervision of Professor [Se Young Chun](https://icl.snu.ac.kr/pi) at [Intelligent Computational imaging Lab](https://icl.snu.ac.kr/), I am currently focusing on research in efficient generative models, vision-language-action models, and safety AI.
